Hi,

Thank you so much for volunteering to read the draft of my course, Just JavaScript.

Right now the course is a sequence of mails that I will be drafting and sending to you over the next several months.
There's no charge, but I would like to ask that you respond with any feedback or questions that you might have.

This is a rough draft and I'm not spending too much time and care editing and polishing the manuscript.

It's a raw and relatively unfiltered tour of my understanding of JavaScript and the mental models involved with writing computer programs in JavaScript.

Along the way, I've been collaborating with Maggie Appleton, so you can expect some fun and interesting visuals to accompany the manuscripts!

I hope you enjoy it. The first email will arrive tomorrow.

Cheers,  
Dan
