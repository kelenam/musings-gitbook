In the beginning was the *Value*.

What is a **value**? It’s hard to say.

The question is tautological, similar to asking what a number is in math, or what a point is in geometry. A **value** is a thing in the JavaScript universe.

Numbers are values — but so are a few other things, like objects and functions. However, many things, such as an `if` statement or a variable declaration, are *not values*.
To distinguish values from everything else in my JavaScript program, I like to imagine this drawing of the Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry:

I’m standing on a small asteroid — it is the code of my program.

On its surface, I see the `if` statements and variable declarations, commas, curly braces, and all the other things one might find in the JavaScript code.

My code contains instructions like “make a function call” or “do this thing many times”, or even “throw an error”. I walk through these instructions step by step — running errands from my small asteroid.

But every once in a while, I look up.

On a clear night, I see the different values in the JavaScript sky: booleans, numbers, strings, symbols, functions and objects, `null` and `undefined` — oh my! I might refer to them in my code, but they don’t exist inside my code.

*Values float in the space of the JavaScript universe.*

Broadly, there are two kinds of values.

**Primitive Values** are like stars — cold and distant, but always there when I need them. They are numbers and strings, among other things. I can’t touch them, but I can look up to them and refer to them from my code.

```JavaScript
console.log(2); // 2
console.log("hello"); // "hello"
console.log(undefined); // undefined
```
*That’s the first kind.*

**Objects and Functions** are also values, but they are within my reach. They are like rocks floating nearby my asteroid. I can connect objects and functions to other values or even make more of them if I’m inclined. Still, my powers are limited — for example, I can’t destroy them. Perhaps, that is for the best.

```JavaScript
console.log({}); // {}
console.log([]); // []
console.log(x => x * 2); // x => x * 2
```

*That’s the second kind.*

You might have questions. Good. If you ask a question, the JavaScript universe might answer it! Provided, of course, that you know how to ask.

## Expressions

There are many questions JavaScript can’t answer. If you want to know whether it’s better to confess your true feelings to your best friend or to keep waiting until you both turn into skeletons, JavaScript won’t be of much help.

But there are some questions that JavaScript would be delighted to answer. These questions have a special name — they are called *expressions*.

If we “ask” the expression `2 + 2`, JavaScript will “answer” with the value `4`.
```javascript
console.log(2 + 2); // 4
```

*If expressions are questions, then values are answers.*

I previously said that there are many types of JavaScript values: numbers, strings, objects, and so on. How do we know any particular value’s type?

This sounds like a *question*. Do we dare to ask it?

## The typeof Expression

At first, all values in the JavaScript cosmos might look the same — bright dots in the sky. But if you look closely, you’ll realize there are fewer than ten different types of values. Values of the same type behave in similar ways.

We can ask the type of any value with the `typeof()` expression.

When we aim the `typeof()` expression at the value we want to inspect, JavaScript will answer our question with one of the predetermined string values, such as "`number`", "`string`", or "`object`".

Here are a few examples you can try in the browser console:
```JavaScript
console.log(typeof(2)); // "number"
console.log(typeof("hello")); // "string"
console.log(typeof(undefined)); // "undefined"

console.log(typeof({})); // "object"
console.log(typeof([])); // "object"
console.log(typeof(x => x * 2)); // "function"
```

## Types of Values

As an aspiring astronomer, you might want to know about every type of value that can be observed in the JavaScript sky. After almost twenty five years of studying JavaScript, the scientists have only discovered nine such types:

## Primitive Values

- **Undefined** (`undefined`), used for unintentionally missing values.
- **Null** (`null`), used for intentionally missing values.
- **Booleans** (`true` and `false`), used for logical operations.
- **Numbers** (`-100`, `3.14`, and others), used for math calculations.
- **Strings** ("`hello`", "`abracadabra`", and others), used for text.
- **Symbols** (uncommon), used to hide implementation details.
- **BigInts** (uncommon and new), used for math on big numbers.

##  Objects and Functions

- **Objects** (`{} `and others), used to group related data together.
- **Functions** (`x => x * 2` and others), used to refer to code.

We will talk about each of them in more detail in next chapters.

## Recap

Let’s recap what we know so far:

1. **There are values, and then there’s everything else**. We can think of values as different things “floating” in our JavaScript universe. They don’t exist inside our code, but we can refer to them from our code.
2. **There are two categories of values: there are Primitive Values, and then there are Objects and Functions.** In total, there are nine separate types. Each type serves a specific purpose, but some are rarely used.
3. **Some values are lonely.** For example, `null` is the only value of the Null type, and `undefined` is the only value of the Undefined type. As we will learn later, these two lonely values are quite the troublemakers!
4. **We can ask questions with expressions.** JavaScript will answer to us with values. For example, the `2 + 2` expression is answered by `4`.
5. **We can inspect the type of something by wrapping it in a typeof() expression.** For example, `typeof(4)` is the string value "`number`".

## Homework

Now it’s time to put what we learned to action. Even if you already have a decent amount of experience with JavaScript, I suggest not to skip these questions! I personally learned some of these things only a few years ago.

1. Open some JavaScript code that you have been working on and put `console.log(typeof(something))` in it, replacing something with different variables in your code. Can you find an example for every value type in the list above? **Try to “collect” as many types as you can.**
2. Imagine you see some code that checks whether a value is a date: `typeof(value) === 'date'`. Will this code work? **Why or why not?**
3. One of the values mentioned in this chapter “lies” about its type. Concretely, typeof() will return an incorrect answer for it because of a JavaScript bug that is now too late to fix. Unless you already know it, **find this value** by trying `typeof()` for every example in the list above.

I’ll include the answers with the next chapter, but please don’t hesitate to respond with yours!

In the next chapter, we will explore the Primitive Values in more detail. We look at what these different primitive types like numbers and Null have in common, and learn a thing or two about what equality means in JavaScript.

These might seem like small steps, but we’re laying the foundation for everything else to come. We’re building the JavaScript universe, together.
