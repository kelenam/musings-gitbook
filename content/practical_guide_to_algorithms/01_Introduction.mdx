## Intro to Algorithms
A practical Introduction to Algorithms

**Algorithm**: Is a just a collection of steps you take to solve a problem

## Why should you care?
Because we are engineers and we solve problems for a living, being better at solving problems means we are better at what we do.

## What will we cover today?
1. Estimate generally how fast an algorithm is
2. Use some techniques to optimize certain  types of algoirthms
3. Get comfortable with recursion
4. Implement a couple sorting and searching algorithms.
5. Understand the difference between Divide & Conqeur and Dynamic Programming
6. Learn about the pros and cons of the Greedy technique.
7. Cover a recursive brute force algorithm.
