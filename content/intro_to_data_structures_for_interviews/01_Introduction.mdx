## Interview Process

### What to expect
- submitting resume/application
- coding challenge
- recruiter phone screen
- technical phone screen
- onsite interview

Coding challenge is getting more and more popuolar, maybe hacker rank problem solving data structure problem or maybe more trivia related questions, like multiple choice, could be a todo app with no data persistence, or implement a feature on an existing app

phone screen more like get to know you, what culture is like, marketing 
- research about the company and have questions for them

technical phone screen could be cloud environment coding, could be general past project/techs youve worked with, etc.
- might be more than one.

sometimes coding challenge comes after the technical screen.
- onsite interview could be half a day 4-6 hours

examples of tradeoffs youve made with frameworks youve worked with, your experience with them, etc.
- Bigger companinies more data-structure centric.

Startups, typically want you to hit the ground running and being productive.

Somtimes technical phone screens are just about high level questions about your domain expertise. 
No coding, just comparing data flow through application, comparing different frameworks, how would you set up a project for the first time, etc.

## Interview Skills at Each Step
Things they are Looking for...
- resume/application: 
    - get a reference, a contact, someone in the company/network
    - guages relevaent experience
- coding challenge
    - clean, correct code
- recruiter phone screen:
    - interest in role, company, culture fit
- technical phone screen:
    - guage tech ability & fit
- onsite interview:
    - guage tech ability & fit

How to Over-achieve
- resume/application:  
    - recommendation from somone
- coding challenge 
    - use a linter, ensure you clearly understand problems
    - add tests
    - descriptive comments
- recruiter phone screen: 
    - read the engineering blog
    - relevant press about the copmany
    - ask engaging questions
    - have highlight ready
- technical phone screen: 
    - have a converational tone
    - communicate the entire way.
    - be able to discuss previous projects in-depth
- onsite interview: 
    - know your DS
    - your language of choice
    - and be friendly but still professional

Read about the company, their enigneering blog if they have one. Read up on them.
- fit just basically means, do they like you do they think they enjoy working with you
- communcication is key, don't be silent if you can help it, ask them how their weekend was, socialable, confident

- sometimes technical phone screens could be like fizz buzz, or more like a shorter onsite.
- know your data structures and algos, 
- have your recent projects as highlight reels ready in your mind, how you worked through them...
- how have you resolved isses?

Biana responsds to, who are you question...
- Who I am, what i do now, or the project that I'm currently working on or some other technical tidbit going on.
- this is why I love what I do...

## Common Interview Mistakes

- you may not get the feedback you want if you get dropped...

### Some Reasons you bombed
- resume/application:  
    - poorly worded
    - relevant experience hidden
    - grammar
- coding challenge 
    - maybe wasn't clean
    - maybe solved wrong problem, didnt understand what they were asking
    - don't just to conclusions, didn't full understand problem to be solved
- recruiter phone screen: 
    - not excited/polite
    - not having relevant experience that youre talking about
    - maybe offended them
    - (typically to see if youre nice, and a marketing youself thing like your resume)
- technical phone screen: 
    - didn't know your basic DS and algos
    - not prepared, can't just be like, well we dont really use link lists in React or whatever,
    - youre not cramming to remember/know study
    - maybe werent able to articulate your contribution to project
    - any bullet you have on your resume make sure youre able to discuss it
        - at least one thing about, interesting thing, or specifics about it or why.
    - frustrated: would be a red flag, be mindful of your emotional regulation.
- onsite interview: 
    - maybe stayed up too late, got burnt out
    - DS/A poor
    - didn't communicate well, weren't personable
    - maybe didn't communicate why you were stuck and just starred at the white board 
        - like staying silent instead of saying like, well i was thinking about going down this route, but now im thinking...
        - going to take a moment and think about what alternatives to take since my initial assumptions dont feel correct bc of x,y,z
            - shows you are able to collaborate well, and can communicate, also gives interviewer a chance to give you a hint.

## Interview Questions Q&A
Why should we hire you?
What are your unique strengths?
- also really interested in the company and that specific product
- remember you can have your notes, jobn posting,  and resume up when on the phone
- Make sure your web presence is consistent. What is your narrative what is your story make sure it lines up correctly. stay consistent.

What do you think about cracking the coding interview? Yeah, it's great.

Don't recommend taking Algo text books or CS classes. Just need to understand the basic concepts.

How do you handle a question to something you don't know?
- More about breaking a problem down than 'knowing the correct answer' but its a question you can't solve, it's important to be honest.
    - don't pretend things you don't know, you can make inferences, well, I'm not really sure, I've worked with binary tres, but maybe, if I would have to guess, a quad tree is a tree where a node at most can have four nodes. 

What about when you semi know something, know of a concept but don't fully grasp it?
A: talk through your thought process, when you hit a speed bump, maybe its not what I thought it was, maybe I was expecting this but it was that, pausing there might give the interviewer a chance to give you a hint. What are the reasons why that didn't happen? Click handler, maybe css class, maybe thinking aloud what may be causing this.

Sometimes, there might be language specific questions, like closures, recursion, as well as some math/logic questions at well (usually at bigger questions). Somtimes more domain questions, networking how HTTP works, etc.

## Data Structure
What is a data structure?
Arrangement of data, you can define how this data is arranged in memory

Why should I care?..
one technique for being asked a question about ds/a...
what intuition do I have about interview questions and data structure can help me solve this question being asked of me?
How can I reason about this problem based on the DS I know, and the operations I know I can do on these data structures. Like trees, what can I do with the things that I currently know.

Some DSs are in contiguous blocks of memory, which means they are located next to each other, like we can think of an array (JS doesn't actually allocate memory like this though), but you can think about things like this.

Ordered data structures, hierarchical, compelx relationships, we need to represent this some how, we can model and structure data appropriately. searching/sorting and getting particular values in different scenarios.

We can use DS to model real world systems or, the DOM is just a tree, traversing a lot of data, lots of DOM nodes and youre seeing bottle necks. Understanding how you can traverse a tree can help you with that.

### Common Interview Data Structures

| Data Structure    | Common Uses           | FEM Course         |
|-------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
| Arrays & Strings  | ordered data, words   | Part 2 (this one)  |
| Hash Tables       | optimization          | Part 2 (this one)  |
| Linked Lists      | data insert/delete    | Part 2 (this one)  |
| Stacks/Queues     | creative aux DS       | Part 2 (this one)  |
| Trees, Heaps      | hierarchical data     | Part 3             |
| Graphs            | complex relationships | Part 4             | 

- hash tables used to optimize other things, typically quick look up.
- linked lists used to build other ds, under the hood, jS arrays
- stacks and queues under the hood are often linked lists, hash table collisions use a linked lists
- stacks and queues used to keep track of things as an auxilliary data structure
- graphs complex relationships, like the internet, grains of sands on a beach.

### How to be effective 
1. dont aim to memorize, this will not help!  
2. find themes, but don't jump to conclusions (clarify!!)
    - clarify if it's something, like if you think its a stack, clarify youre moving in the right direction
3. practice with a timer, speed matters
    - practice a lot and get fast 
    - 10-30 minutes should be able to wrap it up, try to get this as fast as you can
4. actually practice, reading doesn't code
5. Communicate and be nice!

Actually practicing, struggling through a problem is the most important, one workshop Bianca was at said, struggle for 2 hours before looking for solutions online, 

Even if its not going well, or youre frustrated remember to be polite, it will get you a long way.
